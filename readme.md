# Mapper from scratch

This is a jupyter notebook file which shows a basic run through of the Mapper algorithm.

## Requirements

I use poetry, so running
```sh
poetry install
poetry shell
jupyter
```
Should drop you into an environment which is capable of running this notebook.
Alternatively if you wish to use the `requirements.txt` simply run `pip install
-r requirements.txt` (hopefully in a venv).

Finally, if for some reason none of these work for you for some reason the requirements are minimal:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- networkx
- scikitlearn
